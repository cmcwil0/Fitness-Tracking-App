        "topic": "Macronutrients",
        "info": "Macronutrients are the three main nutrients your body needs in large amounts: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Proteins help build and repair tissues (aim for 0.8-1g per kg of body weight). Carbohydrates provide energy for workouts and daily activities (45-65% of daily calories). Healthy fats support hormone production and nutrient absorption (20-35% of daily calories)."

        "info": "High-quality protein sources include lean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef), fish (salmon, tuna, cod), eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans), tofu, tempeh, and protein supplements. Aim to distribute protein intake throughout the day for optimal muscle protein synthesis."

        "topic": "Post-Workout Nutrition",
        "info": "Within 30-60 minutes after exercise, consume a combination of protein and carbohydrates to support recovery. Good options include protein shakes with fruit, Greek yogurt with granola, chicken with rice, or a turkey sandwich. The 3:1 or 4:1 carb-to-protein ratio is ideal for recovery."

        "topic": "Hydration",
        "info": "Proper hydration is crucial for fitness performance. Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, more if exercising. During workouts longer than 60 minutes, consider electrolyte drinks. Monitor urine color - pale yellow indicates good hydration. Drink 16-20 oz of water 2-3 hours before exercise and 8 oz every 15-20 minutes during exercise."
